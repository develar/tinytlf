	 *

	 * an ITextContainer registered with the ITextLayout layout actor.

	 * participates in layout by rendering as many lines as possible into its 
	 * target DisplayObjectContainer, then returning either:
	 * <ul>
	 * <li>the last line successfully rendered, meaning there's no more room for
	 * lines in the target DisplayObjectContainer, or</li>
	 * <li><code>null</code>, meaning all the lines from the TextBlock were
	 * rendered and there's still more space in the target 
	 * DisplayObjectContainer.</li>
